#TIC TAC MARIO#

This is a tic tac toe game made using Angular.js & Firebase. 

It uses two-way data binding, ng-click and ng-repeat with a fair amount of styling to acheieve the full effect seen on the screen.

There is a score counter that will keep track of X's wins and O's wins, and the text will change based on who's turn it is, or the outcome of the game. 

The first person to load the page is X, while the second is O. There is also a "Start over" button that can be clicked at any time by either player to clear the board, at which time X will start again.
